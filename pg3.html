    <h1>Why was riding the trains during the migration unsafe?</h1>
    <p>   
      On August 13, 1947, India left British rule and became their own country. Muslims had to move to Pakistan and Hindus had to move to India. The most common way to move from one country to another was by train. People were overflowing the train, standing on the roof and killing other people in the train. About 3000 people died and 1000 were injured during the Partition of India. When people where getting on the train, they may have been separated from there family. Nisha saw this happen at the train station her family were at. There was so much conflict because when the land split into India and Pakistan this caused a conflict between Muslims and Hindus because of this split.  (Erin Blakemore)
