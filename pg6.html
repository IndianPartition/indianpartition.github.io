    <h1>How did Nisha's family get water on their journey?</h1>
    <p>   
      Nisha was walking through the country side, they ran out of water. Luckily Nisha and her family found a village as they were walking. This village had a well but there was a long line of people and her brother Amil was going to die. So Nishaâ€™s family laid Amil against a tree and his dad went to try to find some more water because the well was dried up. Luckily, it started to rain and Nisha and her family were saved.
